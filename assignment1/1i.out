Proofs:
1.	[p] seq [p, q]                                 Rule P1
2.	[q] seq [p, q]                                 Rule P1
3.	[p] seq [p, q]  - AND -  [q] seq [p, q]        AND
4.	[] seq [p iff q, p, q]                         Rule P6a
5.	[neg q] seq [p iff q, p]                       Rule P2b
6.	[neg p, neg q] seq [p iff q]                   Rule P2b
7.	[(neg p) and (neg q)] seq [p iff q]            Rule P3b
